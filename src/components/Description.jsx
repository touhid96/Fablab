                The sealing of large areas in the city is a pressing ecological problem and a much-discussed topic in the city. Breaking*Folds aims to raise awareness of this problem and provide a platform for public discussion.

                To this end, students from the University of Bremen and the University of the Arts Bremen have created installations that they are exhibiting in public spaces and in the FabLab in Postamt 5. They have developed algorithmically folded structures that are reminiscent of living plant objects or simulate them and thus intervene in the urban space.

                Nature and organic matter are modulated through and impregnated by folding. One might wonder whether there is a limit to folding within and outside the organic realm of matter, since it seems to involve all scales, from the largest – as with geological folding processes – to the smallest – as with the DNA molecule. Folding is at work everywhere.

                The idea of Breaking*Folds is realized in all our exhibition objects. Breaking Folds is not just an exhibition; it's a celebration of innovation, creativity, and sustainability. Our mission is to showcase the potential of 3D fabrication in promoting sustainable development and environmental conservation.
